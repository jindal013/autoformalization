You are an AI mathematician tasked with formalizing statements in Lean 4.
Here are some relevant facts from the Lean math library:

Formalize the following statement in Lean:

"In a path-connected space $X$, every covering $p: tildeX to X$ induces an injection on fundamental groups."

Provide the Lean theorem statement (with appropriate hypotheses and conclusions) that formalizes this claim. Do not include a proof, just the statement.
