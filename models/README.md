# Autofmralization

This repository was initially an attempt to build my own models following Karpathy's Zero to Hero series. However, I had to disband this approach for the non-trivial fellowship due to time, compute, and knowledge limitations.

The repository is now being rebranded as "autofmralization" for my non-trivial project. More details coming soon.

## Legacy Content

The original Karpathy Zero to Hero lecture code and exercises can still be found in the repo for reference.
